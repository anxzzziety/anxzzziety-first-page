        <h2>The Good</h2>
        <p>*Bangkok has a strong presence of the English language in signage and their skytrain system, which helps in navigation.</p>
        <p>*There is a good currency transfer rate from U.S. Dollar to Thai Baht.</p>
        <p>*There are numerous Temples (Thai translation is Wat) to visit. Many of which are very large and have elaborate artistic detail work inside and outside of the structures/statues.</p>
        <P>*Thailand has multiple Islands (Thai translation is Koh) all along the southern borders. Many of which have very clear water along their coastlines.</P>

      <h3>The Bad</h3>
      <p>*There are many scams against tourist operated by taxi drivers. When using a cab, ask for meter use before getting in. If they say anything related to "no meter", do not get in.</p>
      <p>*Like many places outside of the U.S. borders, do not drink the water. Drink bottled water from sealed containers. Even ice can be an issue depending on the sources.</p>
      <p>*You must, and I repeat must, have a tolerance for spicy foods. Their diets are built around peppers. I used a local Thai restaurant to help build up my tolerance and I can only handle a small percentage of their normal levels.</p>
      <p>*Going beyond larger tourist cities and venturing into the rural areas, you will be traveling outside of the English language zones. A translator will be a necessity.</p>
      <p>*Be careful and study some cultural norms before traveling. Some liberties that we are used to, are shunned and can even be illegal there.</p>
